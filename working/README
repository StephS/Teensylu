This board is a PROTOTYPE until the design is built and tested.

Version 1.0 is ready for production, earlier versions should not be used.

Please see TeensyluV1_Pin_Map.htm for the correct pin mapping using the teensyduino library. Analog pins should use the analog pin reference.

The BOM is included. Please use parts of the same or higher ratings.
